<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project was my final assignment for the Unleashing Open Data With Python course at Johns Hopkins University. I took this class in the Fall of 2020. 

My research question was, "What is the relationship between United States residents' willingness to participate in the United States Census and their political party affiliation?"

The United States Census determines how many voters reside in the United States and subsequently informs how many electors and representatives each state is allotted. In addition, census data is publically available and commonly used in academic research. It is of the utmost importance to understand current attitudes about the Census for these reasons. The government and private sector alike can target specific groups of people with education campaigns once individuals unlikely to participate in the Census are identified. In doing so, true representation will improve.

## Tools
The dataset is from Pew Research Center, the product of a survey they conducted in early 2020. For the analysis, I used various Python packages, HTML, and statistical analysis. 
* [Python](https://www.python.org/doc/)
* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/devel/index)
* [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

<!-- Analysis -->
## Analysis
First, I cleaned the dataset to include the independent and dependent variables of interest. Next, I performed exploratory data analysis (including descriptive statistics) to get to know the data. Finally, I ran regression on the aforementioned variables. This included analyzing the bivariate and multivariate results, retesting with control variables, interpreting the coefficients, and finally conducting a hypothesis test. You can find the null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, t-score, and results of the test in the Jupyter notebok.

<!-- Conclusions -->
## Conclusions
While over 15% of Pew Research Center's Survey respondents "might not", "probably will not", or "definitely will not" participate in the US Census, party affiliation does not have a statistically significant influence on this attitude. Further analysis is required to determine what other potential variables may have an impact. A few areas to explore include ethnicity, citizenship, education, age, what individual believe the US Census is used for, and self-perceived importance of the US Census.

<!-- Next Steps -->
## Next Steps
While the results of this analysis were not particularly fascinating, I believe there are other variables that may have a stronger impact on this sentiment than political party. Next, I would conduct the same analysis using other variables found in the dataset. Some interesting variables may be citizenship, geographic location, ethnicity, income, and the individual's state of residents federal political affiliation.
